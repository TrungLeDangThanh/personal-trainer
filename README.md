I'm a beginner to coding. This is my first project where I learn to build AI chatbot with OpenAI Assistant API and create a simple user interface with Streamlit. To run the code, checkout requirements.txt and download required libraries. You also need a '.env' file that contains the OPENAI_API_KEY but sorry I can't give you that. Use your own OPENAI_API_KEY instead. Then from terminal type "Streamlit run main.py" to run the code.
